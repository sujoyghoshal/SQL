1. SQL 👍
 * sql is the strature quary language 
 * it used the store ,manipulate ,retrive data from RDMS.
 * it is not a database it is a language used to interact with database.

 we also use the curd operation in sql 
  * Create
  * Read
  * Update
  * Delete

No-SQL: not only sql.

2. what are the diffrent type of sql command?

  *There are 5 type type of command are there.
  1.DDL:  data  defination language =>Create,Drop,Alter,Rename,Truncate
  2.DCL:  data control language =>Grant,Revoke
  3.DML:  data maipulate language =>Insert,Update,Delete
  4.DQL:  data quary language => SELECT
  5.TCL:  Transaction control language =>Commit,Rollback,Start Transaction,Savepoint



3.primary key:

   *primary key is the constrint uniquely identifies each record in a table
   *it is not null.
   *unique + not null + no duplicates.
   *a table have one primary key also.
    
    create table student(
        id int not null,
        primary key(id)
    );



4.Foreign Key:

   *A Foreign key is a column or set of column in a table that refers primary key.
   *There can be multipal Foreign key.
   *Suppose i have a two table when one table primary key also refers to another table column that also Foreign key.
    
    create table student(
        course_id int,
        Foreign key(course_id) refers teacher(id)
    )



super key:
   * A super key is a combination of all possible attribute which can uniquely identifies two tuple in a table.
   * super key=candiate key(c.k)+any attribute.

   Ex:
     suppose i have student table have rollno,name,age attribute there
     *candiate key is rollno
     *rollno+name=super key
      rollno+age=super key
      rollno+name+age=super key


5.what is different between CHAR and VARCHAR?

=> char: 
    *CHAR stands for “Character”.
    *CHAR datatype is used to store character strings of fixed length.
    *CHAR takes 1 byte for each character.
    *Better performance than VARCHAR.

=> varchar:
    *VARCHAR stands for “Variable Character”.
    *VARCHAR datatype is used to store character strings of variable length.
    *VARCHAR takes 1 byte for each character and some extra bytes for holding length information.
    *Performance is not good as compared to CHAR.

    craete table student(
        rollno int primary key,
        name varchar(50)
    );


6.what is the join?
  *Join is used to combine rows from two or more table.
  *Based on related column between them.
  
  There are 4 type of join are there
  1. Inner join
  2. Left join (outer join)
  3. Right join(outer join)
  4. Full join (outer join)

  inner join :
    *return records that have matching value both table
    *
      SELECT  column from tableA
      inner join tableB
      on tableA.col_name=tableB.col_name;

  left join :
    *return all record from the left table 
    *and match record from the right table

    SELECT column
    from tableA
    left join tableB
    on tableA.col_name=tableB.col_name;

  Right join
    *return all record from right table
    *and match the record from left table

    SELECT column
    from tableA
    right join tableB
    on tableA.col_name=tableB.col_name;

  Full Join;
    *return all the record is a match in either left or right table

    left join
    union
    right join


    SELECT*from student as a
    left join course as b
    on a.id=b.id
    union
    SELECT*from student as a
    right join course as b
    on a.id=b.id;


7.what is subquary?
  * A subquary or inner quary or nested quary within  another sql quary.
  * There are two types of subquary are there-

     1.Nested subquary
     2.Correlated subquary

  Nested subquary:
     *inner quary runs first, and only one outer quary executed with result that is called Nested quary.
     *Its is also Bottom up Aproch.
     *in ,not in, equal use
     *
       select * 
       from table
       where salary=select max(salary);


  Correlated subquary:
    *outer quary execution first.
    *and every outer quary row inner quary executed.
    *it is also top down approch.
    *exist,not exist 

   SELECT column
   From tablename
   where col_name
   (subquary);

------------------------------------------------
8.what are indexes?

  * index is a quick lookup table for finding records which  we can search.

   CREATE INDEX index_name
   ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);


9. what is normalization?
------------------------------------------------
 *Normalization is the normal form of process and  eliminate data redundancy 
  and enhance data integrity in the table.

  there are 4 type of normalization are there
  1.1NF
  2.2NF
  3.3NF
  4.BCNF(2.5NF)


10.ACID
-----------------------------------------------------------------

ACID is  4 key properties that define a transaction:
  A->Atomicity, 
  c->Consistency, 
  i->Isolation,
  d->Durability

*Atomicity: either all or none means suppose i have craete transaction 
        before commit the transaction will be failure and go to the start of the transaction that called also rollback it also called the Atomicity.
        
        T1 -------
        R(A)      |
        A=A+50    |
        W(A)      |
        R(A)  ----
        //Commit


*Consistency:
     before transaction and after transaction the total sum will be same that also called Consistency.

     suppose A send the money B 1000
     A->B 
     A have -> 2000
     B have -> 3000

       T1
   -----------
      R(A)
      A=A-1000;
      R(A) ->1000 (stored in the local memory)
      R(B)
      B=B+1000
      W(B) -> 4000
      //commit

      so,before transaction and after transaction the total money should be same.

  
*Isolation :
  *multipal transaction when woork paralel that called Isolation.

   t1  | t2 |  t3 |
  -------------------------
       |    |     |
       |    |     |
       |    |     |

*Durability:
  *its means all transaction will be parmanent save in the database that called Durability.


11.Transaction?
 *A transaction is a sequence of SQL statements thatare executed as a single logical unit of work. 
 Itensures data consistency and integrity by eithercommitting all changes or rolling them back if anerror occurs.


  1.Active
  2.partial commited
  3.commited
  4.faild
  5.Abort

 
 what is difference between union and union all in sql

 *The main difference between UNION and UNION ALL is that: 
  UNION: only keeps unique records. 
  UNION ALL: keeps all records, including duplicates.



what is dead Lock Transaction?
=>
  when two or more transactionsare waiting for each other to release resources,resulting in a circular dependency. 
  As a result, none of the transactions can proceed, and the system lock create that also called deadlock.



view:
  *view is bescially virtual table not real table.
  *view is the result of stored quary.
  *Read only and update view.
  *Matalized View: its means that suppose a remote server is running our project that also called Matalized view.


  *create view v1 as select id 
   from student;
  
  *advantage:
    *to restrict databse.
    *to make complex quary easy.



Where vs Having ?

*Where
   *Group by clause
   *Not use Aggreation function
   *Select,update,Delete use
   *used filter data in a table specied condision.
   *Used single function like-asc,des,upper,lower


Having
   *Cannot use Group By clause
   *Use Aggreation function
   *Select only use
   *used files data in a table Group By condision.
   *multipal function used like-max(),min(),avg(),count()


DELETE:   Removes rows from a table and can be rolled back.
TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table but does not log individual row deletions, faster than DELETE.
DROP:     Deletes the table structure and its data permanently.


clustered index:
   * a clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table.
   * a table can have only one clustered index.
   * it change the way data is sorted on disk and can created only one coloum.

non clustered index:
   * does not affect the physical order of a table.
   * a table can have multipal non-clustered index.
   * its store separetly contains a pointer actual data.

 Grant:
  *the Grant statement is used to grant specific permission,
   or privileges to user roles in a database.


How do you handle NULL values in SQL?
  *NULL values represent missing or unknown data. 
   You can handle NULL values using IS NULL,
   IS NOT NULL, and functions like COALESCE() or IFNULL().
