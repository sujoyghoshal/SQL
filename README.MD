# SQL and No-SQL Overview

## 1. SQL

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language) is used for managing and manipulating data in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
- **SQL** is not a database but a language for interacting with databases.
- Common SQL operations are often referred to as **CRUD operations**:
  - **Create**
  - **Read**
  - **Update**
  - **Delete**

- **No-SQL** stands for "Not Only SQL" and encompasses a variety of database systems that don't adhere strictly to the relational model.

## 2. Different Types of SQL Commands

There are five types of SQL commands:

1. **DQL** (Data Query Language) 
   - **SELECT**

2. **DDL** (Data Definition Language)
   - **CREATE**, **DROP**, **ALTER**, **RENAME**, **TRUNCATE**

3. **DML** (Data Manipulation Language)
   - **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, **DELETE**

4. **DCL** (Data Control Language)
   - **GRANT**, **REVOKE**

5. **TCL** (Transaction Control Language)
   - **COMMIT**, **ROLLBACK**, **START TRANSACTION**, **SAVEPOINT**

## 3. Primary Key

- A **Primary Key** is a constraint that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- It cannot be **NULL** and each table can have only one primary key.
